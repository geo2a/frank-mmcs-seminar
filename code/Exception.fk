catch [Exception E ? X] [] Either E X
catch [x]            = right x
catch [throw e ? k]  = left e

  catch' [Exception E ? X] [] Maybe X
  catch' [x]            = just x
  catch' [throw e ? k]  = nothing

note Usage example, needs Nat.fk

ex [Exception Char] Char
ex = 'a' >> throw 'b' {}

main [] Either Char Char
main = catch ? exasd!
